# Dice Game ðŸŽ²

This is a simple web-based project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project simulates a dice game with two players. Each player has a dice assigned to them, and whenever the page reloads, the dice are rolled, and the player with the higher number wins.

## Project Demo

You can view the project by clicking on the following URL: [https://harshdigi.github.io/dice/](https://harshdigi.github.io/dice/)

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the elements and layout of the web page.
- JavaScript: Used for generating random numbers, determining the winner, and updating the UI.

## How It Works

1. When the web page loads, the JavaScript code is executed.
2. The JavaScript code generates random numbers between 1 and 6 for both players' dice.
3. The code compares the numbers and determines the winner based on the higher number.
4. The UI is updated to display the dice roll results and the winner.
5. Each time the page is reloaded, the dice are rolled again, and the winner is determined anew.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and content of the web page.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles and layout for the web page.
- `script.js`: Includes the JavaScript code for generating random numbers, determining the winner, and updating the UI.

## Usage

To use the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The web page will load, and the dice will be rolled automatically, showing the winner.

## Project Customization

If you want to modify or enhance the project, you can make changes in the following files:

- `index.html`: Modify the HTML structure or content to customize the web page layout.
- `style.css`: Update the CSS styles to change the appearance of the web page.
- `script.js`: Modify the JavaScript code to add new features or change the game logic.
